To start the project, clone this and cd into the directory.
Once you do so, type in the command line python3 -m venv launcherenv(or any name really).
if you are on windows then type **launcherenv\Scripts\activate.bat**
if you are on unix/mac type **source launcherenv/bin/activate**
instead of launcherenv you can type whatever you named your environment
then type **pip(or pip3) install -r requirements.txt**
You are now good to go :)
